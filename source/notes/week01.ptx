        <title>Differential Equations</title>
        <p>
            A <term>differential equation</term> is just an equation that involves the derivative 
            of a function. Consider the equation
            <men xml:id="eqn-sinODE">
                \dfrac{d^4y}{(dx)^4} = y
            </men>
            This is a differential equation.
